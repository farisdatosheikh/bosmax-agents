## IMPORTANT: AGENT NATURE

All 14 units listed below are **Claude Code prompt-level skill personas**.
They are `.md` instruction files. They are NOT autonomous runtime processes, NOT deployed containers,
and NOT background services. They execute within a human-initiated Claude Code session only.

| **Upstream** | BOSMAX Orchestrator (Route BULK) |
| **Downstream** | `bosmax-compliance-gate` (per batch output) |
| **Status** | Prompt-level Claude Code persona — NOT autonomous runtime |
| **Hard rule** | Variant Plan MUST be approved by operator before any row is expanded. Each row MUST resolve back to a single-output deterministic path. Maximum 50 outputs per run; split larger batches into chunks. |

| **Inputs** | Compliance verdict from `bosmax-compliance-gate`; approved final prompt or abort reason; declared gaps or warnings (if any) |
| **Outputs** | Clean user-facing final delivery: copy-paste prompt block + QA status line + gaps/warnings if present; OR ABORT declaration with resolution instruction |
